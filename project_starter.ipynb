# AgentsVille Trip Planner - Project Assignment

In this project, you'll implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!

Your AI system will demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:

1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Your agent will act as a specialized travel planner
2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries
3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles
4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans

You'll simulate external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, process this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. Last, you'll implement a feedback loop to refine the plan.

Your task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!

## Project Instructions

Here are the steps you'll follow:

1. **Define Vacation Details**
    - Specify the trip duration, interests, and constraints.
    - Use Pydantic to structure and verify this information in a class called `VacationInfo`.
2. **Review Weather and Activity schedules**
    - Simulate API calls to gather weather data and available activities in bulk
    - Review the data manually to understand the available options
3. **The ItineraryAgent**
    - Implement an agent that generates a day-by-day itinerary based on the vacation details
    - The system prompt will guide the agent's reasoning through a step-by-step planning process to take travel preferences (e.g. destination, dates, interests) and generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary
    - Craft the components of the prompt (including the role, task/instructions, output format, examples, and context) to elicit the best possible itinerary in one LLM call
4. **Evaluating the Itinerary**
    - Evaluate the itinerary using a set of criteria to ensure a high-quality travel plan
        - For instance, does the itinerary match the city and the dates requested?
        - Or, is the total cost calulation accurate and is it within budget?
        - Or, does the agent hallucinate any activities that are not available?
        - Or, does the agent suggest activities that are not suitable for the weather? This specific evaluation function will require the use of an LLM to compare the event description against the weather data.
5. **Defining the Tools**
    - We will define four tools to assist the agent
        - **calculator_tool**: to accurately calculate costs
        - **get_activities_by_date_tool**: to retrieve activities for a specific date
        - **run_evals_tool**: to evaluate the itinerary against the criteria
        - **final_answer_tool**: to provide the final answer in a structured format
6. **The ItineraryRevisionAgent**
    - We will implement a second agent that revises the itinerary based on feedback using the ReAct THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle.
        - The LLM will first generated a THOUGHT / ACTION message, which contains reasoning steps and a tool call invocation.
        - The Python code will parse the tool call and execute it, returning the result as a string to the LLM in an OBSERVATION message.
        - After this cycle repeats n number of times, the LLM will invoke the final_answer_tool to signal to the Python code to end the loop and return the final answer.
    - This agent will also **incorporate feedback on the initial itinerary** from the travelers to ensure the final plan has **at least 2 activities per day**. A new evaluation function using a powerful LLM will be created to check this user feedback.
    - The agent will use the tools above to refine the plan iteratively, checking the weather and available activities, and ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints.
7. **Something just for fun!**
    - To wrap things up we'll create a fun, narrative summary of the trip, highlighting the best activities and experiences!
## Initial Setup

Let's start with settin up our environment and defining the vacation details.
# When using VSCode in the Udacity workspace, add /workspace to the PYTHON_PATH
import os
import sys

WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY = "/workspace"
if os.path.exists(WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY) and WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY)
    print(f"Added {WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY} to the Python path")
# Install required packages if not already installed
# No changes needed here.
%pip install -q json-repair==0.47.1 numexpr==2.11.0 openai==1.74.0 pandas==2.3.0 pydantic==2.11.7 python-dotenv==1.1.0
# If using the Vocareum API endpoint
# TODO: Fill in the missing parts marked with **********
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    # Change the base_url when using the Vocareum API endpoint
    # If using the OpenAI API endpoint, you can comment out the base_url line
    base_url="https://openai.vocareum.com/v1",
    # Uncomment one of the following
    api_key="xxxx",  # <--- TODO: Fill in your Vocareum API key here
)

# Throughout this project you can experiment with different OpenAI models.
# By default we will use GPT-4.1-mini, which is a good balance of speed and cost.
from enum import Enum

class OpenAIModel(str, Enum):
    GPT_41 = "gpt-4.1"  # Strong default choice for development tasks, particularly those requiring speed, responsiveness, and general-purpose reasoning. 
    GPT_41_MINI = "gpt-4.1-mini"  # Fast and affordable, good for brainstorming, drafting, and tasks that don't require the full power of GPT-4.1.
    GPT_41_NANO = "gpt-4.1-nano"  # The fastest and cheapest model, suitable for lightweight tasks, high-frequency usage, and edge computing.

MODEL = OpenAIModel.GPT_41_MINI  # Default model for this project

## Define Vacation Details

Let's encode the details of our vacation in JSON format and verify it using Pydantic.

In practice, a chatbot agent could gather the information of a user. After it has gathered all the information it needs, it could generate this JSON object from the chat transcript. We will skip that step to focus on the itinerary generation itself.
# The Vacation Info Data Structure
# No changes needed here, but you may choose to personalize the data.

# If all assertions pass, print a success message
print("✅ VacationInfo data structure is valid!")
## Review Weather and Activity Schedules

Now that we have the trip details, we can retrieve the weather and activity schedules for the dates of the trip.

We will call an API to get all the data at once, in order to be able to include it in the context for our itinerary planning agent.

Also, we will format the data as Pandas DataFrames for easier viewing. Take the time to read and understand the data to see if the agent notices the same things you do. For instance:
- What does the weather look like for the trip? On what days it is sunny, rainy, or cloudy?
- What activities are available on each day? Are there any special events or festivals related to the user's interests?

## The ItineraryAgent

First we will review the Pydantic objects used for defining the output of our agent, the TravelPlan, ItineraryDay, Activity, and Weather classes.

Second, we will create a Chain-of-Thought prompt to guide the agent in planning the trip. This prompt will instruct the agent to consider the weather, activities, and user preferences when creating the itinerary.

Third, we will run the agent to produce the TravelPlan object, which will will refine in the following steps.
# Review the data structure we will use for representing a TravelPlan, which includes
# weather, activity_recommendations, and itinerary for each day of the trip.
# Our goal is to take a VacationInfo object and return a TravelPlan object.

ITINERARY_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""
[Role]
You are an expert travel planning agent.

[Task]
Create a travel itinerary for the given VacationInfo, using ONLY the provided:
- Weather records
- Activity records

You MUST:
- Recommend ONLY activities that appear in the provided Activities Data.
- Use ONLY activity_id values that appear in Activities Data.
- Put activities on the correct date.
- Align recommendations with the travelers' interests.
- Keep total_cost within the provided budget.
- Ensure at least ONE recommended activity per day.
- Avoid weather-incompatible activities (e.g., outdoor-only during storms/heavy rain) based on the activity description and weather condition.
- Do NOT invent activities, IDs, prices, times, or weather.

[Important Data Rules]
- "activity_recommendations" MUST be a list of objects with EXACTLY:
  - "activity": an Activity object (NOT nested again inside another "activity")
  - "reasons_for_recommendation": list of strings
- "activity" must NOT be double-wrapped like {{"activity": {{"activity": ...}}}}.
- start_time and end_time MUST be ISO datetimes (e.g., "2025-06-10T09:00:00"), not "HH:MM".
- Use the weather fields EXACTLY as: temperature, temperature_unit, condition.

[Output Format — STRICT]
Return ONLY a single valid JSON object and NOTHING else.
No markdown. No code fences. No extra keys.

The JSON MUST match EXACTLY this schema:

{{
  "city": "<string>",
  "start_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
  "end_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
  "total_cost": <int>,
  "itinerary_days": [

      "weather": {{
        "temperature": <number>,

        "condition": "<string>"
      }},
      "activity_recommendations": [
        {{
          "activity": {{

## Evaluating the Itinerary

We've successfully created an itinerary, but how do we know if it's any good?

Now we will create some evaluation functions (sometimes called evals) to help us determine the quality of the itinerary. We will not only want our final output to be of the highest quality possible initially, but we also want to give the chance for the LLM to reflect on its own output and make improvements at a second pass.

If the itinerary does not meet all the criteria specified here, no worries! Afterwards, we will implement a feedback loop that will allow the agent to improve its plan iteratively.

ITINERARY_REVISION_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
[Role]
You are an Itinerary Revision Agent.

[Goal]
Revise an existing TravelPlan to fully incorporate traveler feedback while satisfying ALL constraints
and passing ALL evaluation checks.

Traveler feedback for this run:
"{TRAVELER_FEEDBACK}"

[Hard Constraints — MUST NOT BE VIOLATED]
- All activities MUST be real and MUST come from the mocked activities API.
- You may ONLY obtain activities via get_activities_by_date_tool.
- When you include an activity, you MUST copy it EXACTLY as returned by the tool
  (no edits to id, name, times, description, price, or related_interests).
- The final plan MUST contain at least TWO activity_recommendations for EVERY itinerary day.
  This requirement has NO exceptions, including bad weather.
- If weather is severe, select indoor activities or activities whose description clearly
  supports an indoor or backup option.
- If fewer than two compatible activities exist on a day, you MUST call
  get_activities_by_date_tool for that date and try again.
- total_cost MUST equal the sum of prices of ALL recommended activities across ALL days
  and MUST be within the vacation budget.

[Available Tools — EXACT NAMES ONLY]
You may call ONLY the following tools:
- calculator_tool(input_expression: str) -> float
- get_activities_by_date_tool(date: str, city: str) -> List[Activity]
- run_evals_tool(travel_plan: TravelPlan | dict) -> dict   # returns success + failures
- final_answer_tool(final_output: TravelPlan | dict) -> TravelPlan

[Required Revision Loop]
You MUST follow this process:
1) Identify what traveler feedback or evaluation constraints are not yet satisfied.
2) If you need more activities for a specific date, call get_activities_by_date_tool for that date.
3) Modify the TravelPlan by:
   - Adding or replacing activity_recommendations for the relevant day(s)
   - Including reasons_for_recommendation for each activity
   - Recomputing total_cost (use calculator_tool if helpful)
4) Call run_evals_tool on the updated plan.
5) Repeat steps 1–4 until run_evals_tool returns success=true.
6) ONLY THEN call final_answer_tool with the final TravelPlan.

[Anti-Loop Rules]
- You may call get_activities_by_date_tool for a given date at most ONCE unless run_evals_tool indicates you still lack activities.
- After calling get_activities_by_date_tool, your NEXT action MUST be either:
  (a) run_evals_tool with an updated travel_plan, OR
  (b) final_answer_tool (only if all constraints are satisfied).
- You MUST NOT call get_activities_by_date_tool twice in a row for the same date.

[Output Format — STRICT]
Every response MUST contain exactly TWO sections:

THOUGHT:
A brief explanation of what you are fixing or checking next.

ACTION:
{
  "tool_name": "<calculator_tool | get_activities_by_date_tool | run_evals_tool | final_answer_tool>",
  "arguments": { ... }
}

Rules:
- Only ONE ACTION per response.
- ACTION must be valid JSON.
- Do NOT include explanations outside the THOUGHT section.

[TravelPlan Schema — MUST MATCH EXACTLY]
The TravelPlan you revise MUST conform to this schema and MUST NOT include extra keys:

{
  "city": "<string>",
  "start_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
  "end_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
  "total_cost": <int>,
  "itinerary_days": [
    {
      "date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
      "weather": {
        "temperature": <number>,
        "temperature_unit": "<string>",
        "condition": "<string>"
      },
      "activity_recommendations": [
        {
          "activity": {
            "activity_id": "<string>",
            "name": "<string>",
            "start_time": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS>",
            "end_time": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS>",
            "location": "<string>",
            "description": "<string>",
            "price": <int>,
            "related_interests": ["<string>", "..."]
          },
          "reasons_for_recommendation": ["<string>", "..."]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

CRITICAL:
- The "activity" field must contain the Activity fields DIRECTLY (activity_id, name, start_time, ...).
- Do NOT double-nest it.
  ✅ Correct:  {"activity": {"activity_id": "...", ...}, "reasons_for_recommendation": [...]}
  ❌ Wrong:    {"activity": {"activity": {"activity_id": "...", ...}}}

[Important Notes]
- activity_recommendations MUST be a list of objects with EXACTLY the keys
  "activity" and "reasons_for_recommendation".
- Do NOT add keys such as "budget", "itinerary_summary", "activities", "transfers",
  "backup_options", or any other non-schema fields.
- Datetimes MUST be ISO 8601 strings.
- You will be given the current TravelPlan in the conversation messages.
